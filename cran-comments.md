## R CMD check results   
Locally and on win-builder there were no ERRORs, no WARNINGs, and no NOTEs.  

On win-builder there were no ERRORs nor WARNINGs. There was one NOTE:

  Maintainer: 'Mihaljevic Bojan <boki.mihaljevic@gmail.com>'
  
  New maintainer:
    Mihaljevic Bojan <boki.mihaljevic@gmail.com>
  Old maintainer(s):
  
This note is simply signalling that I have updated my email address in the package DESCRIPTION. 
  
On travis ci there were no ERRORs nor WARNINGs. There was one NOTE:

  checking installed package size ... NOTE 
    installed size is  7.9Mb 
    sub-directories of 1Mb or more: 
      libs   7.1Mb  
      
This was probably due to a -g compilation flag that I do not currently know how to remove. It does not occur in other environments.
